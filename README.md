# code-quiz

This is homework for week four.

We are assigned the task of creating a timed quiz for bootcamp students to take. It is completed when there is a start button, we have generated questions, a running timer that deducts time for wrong answers, and the game ends when the timer hits 0 or all the questions have been answered. We also need to create a way to store intials attached to highscores.
